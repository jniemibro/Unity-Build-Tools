# Unity Build Tools
Build tools for Unity. Use BuildTemplates within the Unity Editor or build from the command line.
The shell script has only been tested on macOS.


Setup:
---
- Place the 'NBROS Build Tools' folder in your Editor directory.
- Place the 'Commands' folder in the same directory as your Unity Project.
	- There should be a parent directory that contains your Unity project, e.g. MY_GAME/MY_GAME_UNITY_PROJECT. The 'Commands' directory should be placed alongside your project. (MY_GAME/Commands)
